Please keep these points in mind when working on this project:

-> Use the url.properties file in src/ folder to edit the url and port of host network. 
	The provisioning user in oracle is defined by the variable provId.

-> Edit the src/dbConnection/Provider.java to modify oracle connectivity values.
